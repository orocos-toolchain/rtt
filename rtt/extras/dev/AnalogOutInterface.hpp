/* Klaas Gadeyne, Mon August 11 2003
   - Added "channel" param to lowest(), highest(), resolution() calls (these
   are mostly configurable on a per channel basis.  If not, there's
   no problem
   - In comedi, this is also done for their "binary"-counterpoles.  I
   don't know if this is necessary

   Klaas Gadeyne, Wed August 20 2003
   - Added rangeSet() and arefSet() methods, that allready existed in
   the comedi implementations of these interfaces
