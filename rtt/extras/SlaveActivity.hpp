     * @brief An base::ActivityInterface implementation which executes
     * 'step' upon the invocation of 'execute()', which is called by
     * another Activity ('master').  The SlaveActivity can only be started if the
     * master is active or if no master is present. If a master is used,
     * this activity takes periodicity over from the master. If no
     * master is present, use one of the alternative constructors to make
     * a periodic slave or a non periodic slave.
     *
     * Any activity object can be a master of a SlaveActivity,
     * including itself.  A master needs to keep track of its slave
     * itself. There is no standard mechanism in RTT in which masters
     * execute slaves. You need to code this yourself in your master
     * activity by calling execute() on each Slave.
     *
     * The only thing a slave does/can do is
     * * be started and stopped independently.
     * * notifying its master that it was triggered (if present)
     * * copying the periodic/thread properties of its master (if present)
     *
     * \section ExecReact Reactions to execute():
     *
     * In the non periodic case, base::RunnableInterface::loop() is called, in the
     * periodic case, base::RunnableInterface::step() is called. In case the
     * base::RunnableInterface did not implement loop(), step() is invoked by default.
     * If no base::RunnableInterface is given, said functions are called upon
     * SlaveActivity itself.
     *
     * \section TrigReact Reactions to trigger():
     *
     * trigger() is ignored and returns false when no master is present.
     *
     * When there is a master: In the non periodic case, trigger() is
     * called upon the master (causing it to execute), in the periodic
     * case, it is ignored (you can not trigger periodic activities).
