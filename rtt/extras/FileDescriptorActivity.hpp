     * file descriptors. step() (and hence the base::RunnableInterface's step()
     * method) is called when data is available or when an error is encountered
     * on the file descriptor.
     *
     * To use it, one must add the file descriptors to watch in the task's
     * configureHook()
     *
     * <code>
     *   FileDescriptorActivity* fd_activity =
     *      dynamic_cast<FileDescriptorActivity*>(getActivity().get());
     *   if (fd_activity)
     *   {

     *      // optional, set a timeout in milliseconds
     *      fd_activity->setTimeout(1000);
     *      // or in microseconds
     *      fd_activity->setTimeout_us(1000);
     *   }
     * </code>
     *
     * Then, updateHook() and -- when in ERROR state -- errorHook() will be
     * called when one of these three events happen:
     * <ul>
     *      <li>new data is available on one of the watched FDs
     *      <li>an error happens on one of the watched FDs
     *      <li>the timeout is reached
     * </ul>
     *
     * The different cases can be tested in updateHook() as follows:
     *
     * <code>
     * FileDescriptorActivity* fd_activity =
     *    dynamic_cast<FileDescriptorActivity*>(getActivity().get());
     * if (fd_activity)
     * {
     *   if (fd_activity->hasError())
     *   {
     *   }
     *   else if (fd_activity->hasTimeout())
     *   {
     *   }
     *   else
     *   {
     *     // If there is more than one FD, discriminate. Otherwise,
     *     // we don't need to use isUpdated
     *     if (fd_activity->isUpdated(device_fd))
     *     {
     *     }
     *     else if (fd_activity->isUpdated(another_fd))
     *     {
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
