     * @brief The default, thread-less activity for any newly created TaskContext.
     *
     * The presence of this activity object indicates that the TaskContext does
     * not have its own active thread, but executes all asynchronous operations
     * (such as commands and events) in the thread of the caller, so in fact
     * synchronously. The SequentialActivity uses a os::Mutex lock to guard against
     * concurrent executions and makes your TaskContext equally thread-safe as
     * the other activity implementations.
     *
     * This activity emulates the same behaviour as a NonPeriodicActivity, but
     * without using a thread.
     *
     * \section ExecReact Reactions to execute():
     * Always returns false.
     *
     * \section TrigReact Reactions to trigger():
     * This causes step() to be executed.
