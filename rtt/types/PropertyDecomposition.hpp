         * Uses the type decomposition to decompose a property
         * into a property bag that refers to all its parts.
         *
         * It will first try to use the user's TypeInfo::decomposeType function and return
         * that in targetbag if it generates a PropertyBag. If it generated something
         * else than a PropertyBag, this function returns false. If decomposeType
         * did not return anything, it will try the TypeInfo::getMember() approach to
         * decompose source into the targetbag. If no members are returned, this function
         * fails.
         *
         * In case the source type info supports it, each modification of a
         * part in the \a targetbag will modify \a source too. This is so for
         * typekits using the boost::serialization functions in combination with TypeInfo::getMember(). In case the type
         * decompositions were written manually using TypeInfo::decomposeType(), this relation can no longer be
         * guaranteed, and a composition step using TypeInfo::composeType() of the same type must be tried to update
         * \a source with the modifications in \a targetbag.
         *
         * For the TypeInfo::getMember() method: This function can only work if every part of the source
         * is known by the RTT type system. Only the parts of source that are
         * assignable will be decomposed. The read-only parts will be silently omitted.
         *
