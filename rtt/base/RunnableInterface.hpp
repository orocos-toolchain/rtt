     * @brief A class for running a certain piece of code in a thread.
     *
     * It defines three methods which can execute functionality.
     *
     * In a start-run-stop cycle, before step() is called the first time,
     * initialize() will be called in the thread that started this RunnableInterface.
     * When step() is ran the last time in this cycle, finalize() will be
     * called, after it finishes, in the threaad that stopped this RunnableInterface.
     *
     * A non periodic thread will call \a loop(), which indicates that the
     * RunnableInterface is allowed to block ( step() is not allowed to block ).
     * By default, loop() calls step(), but a subclass may override the loop() method
     * to put its own blocking functionality in. To break out of the loop() method,
     * reimplement \a breakLoop() such that loop() returns when breakLoop() is called.
     *
     * The getActivity() method is guaranteed to return a valid task
     * pointer during initialize(), step() or loop() and finalize(). This allows
     * the RunnableInterface to query the task's period(icity) and ThreadInterface.
     * Consequently, initialize() knows whether
     * step() or loop() will be called ( depending on ActivityInterface::isPeriodic() ).
