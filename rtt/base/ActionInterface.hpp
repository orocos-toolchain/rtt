     *
     * @section cc Copy versus clone semantics
     * @par Copy is used to copy a whole tree of actions,
     * storing common information in web of \a internal::DataSource's.
     * The internal::DataSource 'web' will be copied such that an
     * entirely new action tree references the new DataSources.
     * @par When clone is used, the Datasources remain
     * in place, and only the action is cloned, thus,
     * the original and the clone point to the same DataSource.
     * The deletion of DataSources must thus be managed with
     * smart pointers. A clone is thus used for within the
     * existing internal::DataSource web.
