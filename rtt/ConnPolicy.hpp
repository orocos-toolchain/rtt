    /** A connection policy object describes how a given connection should
     * behave. Various parameters are available:
     *
     * <ul>
     *  <li> the connection type: DATA, BUFFER, CIRCULAR_BUFFER or UNBUFFERED.
     *       On a data connection, the reader will have
     *       only access to the last written value. On a buffered connection, a
     *       \a size number of elements can be stored until the reader reads
     *       them. BUFFER drops newer samples on full, CIRCULAR_BUFFER drops older samples on full.
     *       UNBUFFERED is only valid for output streaming connections.
     *
     *  <li> the locking policy: LOCKED, LOCK_FREE or UNSYNC. This defines how locking is done in the
     *       connection. For now, only three policies are available. LOCKED uses
     *       mutexes, LOCK_FREE uses a lock free method and UNSYNC means there's no
     *       synchronisation at all (not thread safe). The latter should
     *       be used only when there is no contention (simultaneous write-read).
     *
     *  <li> if, upon connection, the last value that has been written on the
     *       writer end should be written on the connection as well to
     *       initialize it. This flag has an effect only if the writer has
     *       keepsLastWrittenValue() set to true (see
     *       OutputPortInterface::keepLastWrittenValue()).
     *
     *  <li> if the data is pushed or pulled on the connection. This has an
     *       effect only on multi-process communication. In the pushed case (the
     *       default), new data is actively pushed to the reader's process. In
     *       the pulled case, data must be requested by the reader.
     *
     *  <li> the buffer policy, which controls how multiple connections to the
     *       same input or output port are handled in case of concurrent or subsequent read
     *       and write operations. See \ref BufferPolicy to see all available options.
     *       Not all combinations of buffer policies and the pull flag are valid and non-standard transports
     *       can have additional restrictions.
     *
     *  <li> if the connection is mandatory. Mandatory connections will let the write()
     *       call fail if the new sample cannot be successfully written. Default connections
     *       are not mandatory.
     *
     *  <li> the transport type. Can be used to force a certain kind of transports.
     *       The number is a RTT transport id. When the transport type is zero,
     *       local in-process communication is used, unless one of the ports is
     *       remote. If the transport type deviates from the default remote transport
     *       of one of the ports, an out-of-band transport is setup using that type.
     *
     *  <li> the data size. Some protocols require a hint on big the data will be,
     *       especially if the data is dynamically sized (like std::vector<double>).
     *       If you leave this empty (recommended), the protocol will try to guess it.
     *       The unit of data size is protocol dependent.
     *
     *  <li> the name of the connection. Can be used to coordinate out of band
     *       transport such that they can find each other by name. In practice,
     *       the name contains a port number or file descriptor to be opened.
     *       You only need to provide a name_id if you're using out-of-band transports
     *       without supervisor, for example, when using MQueues without Corba.
     * </ul>
