         * A Thread object executes user code in its own thread.
         *
         * If the underlying OS supports it, both period and priority can be changed
         * after creation. When the period is 0, the loop() function is executed, when
         * the period is greater than 0, the step() function is executed. Note: if the
         * user does not implement loop(), it will call step() by default.
         *
         * The main functions to implement are initialize(), step()/loop() and finalize().
         * initialize() is called when start() is called, and before the first step()/loop() and finalize() is called
         * when stop() is called after the last step()/loop() returns.
         *
         * @section Periodic behavior
         *
         * When a period is set, step() is executed from the moment start() is called,
         * and afterwards according to it's period. When stop() is called, it waits
         * for the step() function to return and then stops the periodic execution.
         *
         * Step() overruns are detected and the threshold to 'emergency stop' the thread can be
         * set by \a setMaxOverrun(). Overruns must be accumulated 'on average' to trigger this behavior:
         * one not overrunning step() compensates for one overrunning step().
         *
         * @section Non periodic behaviour
         *
         * The first invocation of
         * start() invokes the initialize() function and runs the loop()
         * method in the thread.  When loop() returns the thread waits for
         * another start() to execute loop() again. In that case,
         * initialize() is not executed.
         *
         * When stop() is called
         * and the thread is still executing loop() and breakLoop()
         * returns \a true (\b not the default), the stop() function
         * succeeds and the finalize() method is called by stop().
         * If the thread was not executing
         * loop(), stop will always call finalize() and return success.
         *
         * The user must provide an
         * implementation of breakLoop() returning \a true to make stop()
         * work while loop() is being executed. stop() will fail and not execute
         * finalize() if the thread executes loop() and breakLoop() is not
         * reimplemented to return true.
         *
         * @section Periodicities, priorities, schedulers and stack sizes
         *
         * These four parameters are the parameters that users wish to set
         * for every thread created. All but stack size can be modified
         * after creation, and if the OS permits it, modified even when
         * the thread is using user code. All these parameters are passed
         * to the underlying OS unmodified. In case an incorrect combination
         * is made, the change may be rejected or adjusted to a close or
         * safe value.
