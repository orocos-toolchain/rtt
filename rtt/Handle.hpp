     * @brief The Handle holds the information, and allows manipulation, of a connection
     * between a internal::Signal Handler function and the Signal itself.
     *
     * It is returned by the connect() and setup() methods of Signal and can
     * be used to (dis)connect a handler function from the signal.
     * Handle objects may be assigned to each other and will always point
     * to the same connection. If the last Handle object is destroyed,
     * and is not connected, the connection is destroyed. Thus the
     * resource management (deallocation) is handled by Orocos itself.
     *
     * To inspect if the Handle points to a valid, existing connection, one can use :
     * @verbatim
     Handle handle;
     // ...
     if ( !handle ) {
        // not valid !
     }
