     * The BufferPolicy controls how multiple connections to the
     * same input or output port are handled in case of concurrent or subsequent read
     * and write operations.
     *
     * Possible values:
     *
     * - PerConnection:
     *   Buffers (or data objects) will be installed per connection
     *   (per pair of output and input port/stream). Input ports with multiple
     *   connections first try to read from the last read channel first, then
     *   poll all connections in the order they have been made (which in practice
     *   means there are no guarantees on the order if multiple writers write
     *   concurrently). This is the default buffer policy.
     *
     * - PerInputPort:
     *   Every input port has a single input buffer (or data object) and all
     *   connected output ports/streams will write to the same buffer. This
     *   policy requires that pull == false for remote connections or input streams.
     *
     * - PerOutputPort:
     *   Every output has a single output buffer (or data object) and all connected
     *   readers "consume" elements from this buffer. Exactly one connected input port
     *   or output stream will see every written sample as NewData. This policy
     *   requires that pull == true for remote connections or output streams.
     *
     * - Shared:
     *   The buffer (or data object) is shared between all connected input and output
     *   ports. It can have an arbitrary number of writers and readers. Ports can be
     *   connected to an existing shared connection instance either by connecting it
     *   to a port that is already part of the shared connection group, or with a special
     *   createConnection() method. This was the default buffer policy in the days of
     *   RTT v1.
