     * A simple logging class to debug/ analyse what is
     * going on in the Orocos system. You MUST NOT use this
     * logger in a HARD realtime task or thread.
     *
     * You can disable all logging at compile time by
     * defining \a OROBLD_DISABLE_LOGGING (not advised for normal usage).
     * This class can log to a console, and/or to a file and/or to an
     * internal buffer which may be emptied by another class. This
     * is decided upon compile time and can not be changed during runtime.
     * Both printf/iostream are supported.
     *
     * Example Usage :
     * @verbatim
     Logger::log() << Logger::Error << "An error Occured !" << Logger::endl;
     Logger::log() << Logger::Debug << "All debug info ..." << Logger::endl;
     * @endverbatim
     *
     * When the application is started, set the displayed loglevel with
     * setLogLevel() with a LogLevel parameter. The default is Warning. Set the desired log streams
     * ( a file or std output ) with logToStream() and setStdStream(). Additionally,
     * an \a orocos.log  which is always logs
     * at log level 'Info'.
     *
     * If you set an environment variable \a ORO_LOGLEVEL=0..6, this value will be used
     * to determine the output level until overriden by the application (if so).
     * The \a ORO_LOGLEVEL has the same effect on the 'orocos.log' file, but can not lower it below "Info".
     *
     * @warning
     * Use Logger::RealTime to log from real-time threads. As long as the output LogLevel
     * is 6 or lower, these messages will not appear and do no harm to real-time performance.
     * You need to call @verbatim Logger::log().allowRealTime(); @endverbatim once in your program
     * to confirm this choice. AGAIN: THIS WILL BREAK REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE.
