    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Real-time OS Abstraction</title>
      <para>
	The OS package makes an abstraction of the operating system on
	which it runs. It provides C++ interfaces to only the
	<emphasis>minimal set</emphasis> of operating system
	primitives that it needs: mutexes, semaphores and
	threads. This is in accordance with the general developers
	requirements of the project: a minimalistic approach is much
	easier to scale, to maintain, and to port. The abstraction
	also allows &orocos; users to build their software on all
	supported systems with only a recompilation step. The OS
	Abstraction layer is not directly being used by the
	application writer. Basic OS primitives are leading
	programmers to often to pitfalls which can be avoided using
	well known solutions. These solutions are implemented in the
	CoreLib classes and allow the programmer to think in a more
	natural way about the problem.
      </para>
      <para>
	The abstractions cause (almost) no execution overhead, because
	the wrappers can be called in-line. See the <option>OROBLD_OS_AGNOSTIC</option>
	option in CMake build tool to control in-lining.
      </para>

    <title>The Operating System Interface</title>
    <section>
      <title>Basics</title>
      <para>
	Keeping the &orocos; core portable requires an extra
	abstraction of some operating system (OS) functionalities. For
	example, a thread can be created, started, paused, scheduled,
	etc., but each OS uses other function calls to do this.
	&orocos; prefers C++ interfaces, which led to the
	<classname>RTT::OS::ThreadInterface</classname> which allows
	control and provides information about a thread in &orocos;.
      </para>
      <para>
	Three thread classes are available in &orocos;:
	<classname>RTT::OS::PeriodicThread</classname> houses
	a periodic thread and 
	<classname>RTT::OS::SingleThread</classname> is a non periodic thread
	which executes the functionality once each time it is started.
	The <classname>RTT::MainThread</classname> is a special case as
	only one such object exists and represents the thread that
	executes the main() function.
      </para>
      <para>

	respect to device driver interfacing (DI) and the rest of

    <title>OS directory Structure</title>
      <para>
      The OS directory contains C++ classes to access Operating System
      functionality, like creating threads or signaling
      semaphores. Two kinds of subdirectories are used: the CPU <emphasis>architecture</emphasis>
      (i386, powerpc, x86_64) and the Operating System (gnulinux, xenomai, lxrt),
      or <emphasis>target</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>The RTAI/LXRT OS target</title>
      <para>
	RTAI/LXRT is an
	environment that allows user programs to run with real-time
	determinism next to the normal programs. The advantage is
	that the real-time application can use normal system libraries
	for its functioning, like showing a graphical user interface.
      </para>
      <para>
	An introduction to RTAI/LXRT can be found in the <ulink
	  url="http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~psoetens/lxrt/portingtolxrt.html"> 
	  Porting to LXRT HOWTO</ulink>, which is a must-read if you
	don't know what LXRT is.
      </para>
      <para>
	The common rule when using LXRT is that any user space (GNU/Linux)
	library can be used and any header included as long as their non-real-time
	functions are not called from within a hard real-time thread.
	Specifically, this means that all the RTAI (and Orocos) OS functions,
	but not the native Linux ones, may be called from within
	a hard real-time thread. Fortunately these system calls
	can be done from a not hard real-time thread within the
	same program.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Porting Orocos to other Architectures / OSes</title>
      <para>
	The OS directory is the only part of the Real-Time Toolkit
	that needs to be ported to other Operating Systems or
	processor architectures in case the target supports Standard
	C++. The os directory contains code common to all OSes. The
	<emphasis>oro_arch</emphasis> directories contain the
	architecture dependent headers (for example atomic counters
	and compare-and-swap ).
      </para>
      <para>
	In order to start your port, look at the <filename>fosi_interface.h</filename>
	and <filename>fosi_internal_interface.hpp</filename> files in
	the os directory. These two files list the C/C++ function
	signatures of all to be ported functions in order to support
	a new Operating System. The main categories are: time reading, mutexes,
	semaphores and threads.
	The easiest way to port Orocos to another operating system, 
	is to copy the gnulinux directory into a new directory and start
	modifying the functions to match those in your OS.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>OS Header Files</title>
      <para>
	The following table gives a short overview of the available
	headers in the os directory.

    <title>Using Threads and Real-time Execution of Your Program</title>
    <section>
      <title>Writing the Program main()</title>
      <para>
	All tasks in the real-time system have to be performed by some
	thread.  The OS abstraction expects an <function>int
	  ORO_main(int argc, char** argv)</function> function (which
	the user has written) and will call that after all system
	initialisation has been done. Inside ORO_main() the user
	may expect that the system is properly set up and can be used.
	The resulting orocos-rtt library will contain the real main()
	function which will call the ORO_main() function.
      </para>
      <important>
	<para>
	  Do not forget to include
	  <filename>&lt;rtt/os/main.h&gt;</filename> in the main program
	  file, or the linker will not find the ORO_main function.
	</para>
      </important>
      <note>
	<para>
	  Using global objects ( or <emphasis>static</emphasis> class
	  members ) which use the OS functions before ORO_main() is
	  entered (because they are constructed before main() ), can
	  come into conflict with an uninitialised system. It is
	  therefor advised not to use static global objects which use
	  the OS primitives. <classname>Event</classname>s in the
	  CoreLib are an example of objects which should not be
	  constructed as global static. You can use dynamically
	  created (i.e. created with <emphasis>new</emphasis> ) global
	  events instead.
	</para>
      </note>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Orocos Thread System</title>
      <section>
	<title>Periodic Threads</title>
	<para>
	  An &orocos; thread, which must execute a task periodically,
	  is defined by the
	  <classname>RTT::OS::PeriodicThread</classname>. The most
	  common operations are <methodname>start()</methodname>,
	  <methodname>stop()</methodname> and setting the periodicity.
	  What is executed is defined in an user object which
	  implements the
	  <classname>RTT::OS::RunnableInterface</classname>. It
	  contains three methods :
	  <methodname>initialize()</methodname>,
	  <methodname>step()</methodname> and
	  <methodname>finalize()</methodname>. You can inherit from
	  this interface to implement your own functionality. In
	  initialize(), you put the code that has to be executed once
	  when the component is start()'ed. In step(), you put the
	  instructions that must be executed periodically. In
	  finalize(), you put the instructions that must be executed
	  right after the last step() when the component is stop()'ed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, you are encouraged <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> to use
	  the OS classes! The CoreLib uses these classes as a basis to provide a more
	  fundamental activity-based (as opposite to thread based)
	  execution mechanism which will insert your periodic activities in
	  a periodic thread.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Common uses of periodic threads are :
	  <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Running periodic control tasks.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Fetching periodic progress reports.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Running the CoreLib periodic tasks.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Non Periodic Threads</title>
	<para>
	  For non-periodic threads, which block or do lengthy
	  calculations, the <classname>RTT::OS::SingleThread</classname> class
	  can be used.  The RTT uses the SingleThread
	  for the <classname>RTT::NonPeriodicActivity</classname>.  Porting applications to Orocos
	  might benefit this class in a first adaptation step. It
	  has a start() method, which will invoke one single call to
	  the user's loop() function ( in contrast to step() above). It can be
	  re-started each time the loop() function returns. The
	  initialise() functions is called when the
	  SingleThread is started the first time. When stopped,
	  the finalise() function is called after loop() returns.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The user himself is responsible for providing a mechanism to
	  return from the loop() function. The SingleThread expects
	  this mechanism to be implemented in the
	  RunnableInterface::breakLoop() function, which must return
	  true if the loop() function could be signaled to
	  return. SingleThread will call breakLoop() in its stop()
	  method if loop() is still being executed and, if successful,
	  will wait until loop() returns.  The
	  <function>SingleThread::isRunning()</function> function can
	  be used to check if loop() is being executed or not.
	</para>
	<note>
	  <para>The <classname>RTT::NonPeriodicActivity</classname> in
	  CoreLib provides a better integrated implementation for
	  SingleThread and should be favourably used.</para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  Common uses of non periodic threads are :
	  <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Listening for data on a network socket.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Reading a file or files from hard-disk.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Waiting for user input.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Execute a lengthy calculation.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>React to asynchronous events.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The user of this class must be aware that he must provide himself
	  the locking primitives (like RTT::OS::Mutex) to provide thread safety.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Setting the Scheduler and Priorities.</title>
	<para>
	  The Orocos thread priorities are set during thread
	  construction time and can be changed later on with
	  <function>setPriority</function>. Priorities are integer
	  numbers which are passed directly to the underlying OS. One
	  can use priorities portably by using the
	  <classname>RTT::OS::LowestPriority</classname>,
	  <classname>RTT::OS::HighestPriority</classname> and
	  <classname>RTT::OS::IncreasePriority</classname> variables
	  which are defined for each OS.
	</para>
	<para>
	  OSes that support multiple schedulers can use the
	  <function>setScheduler</function> function to influence
	  the scheduling policy of a given thread. Orocos guarantees
	  that the <classname>ORO_SCHED_RT</classname> and
	  <classname>ORO_SCHED_OTHER</classname> variables are 
	  defined and can be used portably. The former `hints'
	  a real-time scheduling policy, while the latter `hints'
	  a not real-time scheduling policy. Each OS may define
	  additional variables which map more appropriately to
	  its scheduler policies. When only one scheduling policy
	  is available, both variables map to the same scheduler.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>ThreadScope: Oscilloscope Monitoring of Orocos Threads</title>
	<para>
	  You can configure the OS layer at compilation time using CMake to
	  report thread execution as block-waves on the parallel port
	  or any other digital output device.  Monitoring through the
	  parallel port requires that a parallel port Device Driver is
	  installed, and for Linux based OSes, that you execute the
	  Orocos program as root.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If the CoreLib Logger is active, it will log the mapping of
	  Threads to the device's output pins to the <filename>orocos.log</filename>
	  file. Just before step() is entered, the pin will be set
	  high, and when step() is left, the pin is set low again.
	  From within any RTT activity function, you may then additionally use the
	  ThreadScope driver as such :
	</para>
	<programlisting>  <classname>RTT::DigitalOutInterface</classname>* pp = DigitalOutInterface::nameserver.getObject("ThreadScope");
if ( pp )
    pp->setBit( this->getTask()->thread()->threadNumber(), value );
  	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  which sets the corresponding bit to a boolean value. The
	  main thread claims pin zero, the other pins are assigned
	  incrementally as each new Orocos thread is created.
	</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Synchronisation Primitives</title>
      <para>
	Orocos OS only provides a few synchronisation primitives,
	mainly for guarding critical sections.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Mutexes</title>
	<para>
	  There are two kinds of Mutexes : <classname>RTT::OS::Mutex</classname>
	  and <classname>RTT::OS::MutexRecursive</classname>. To lock a mutex, it
	  has a method <methodname>lock()</methodname>, to unlock, the method is <methodname>unlock()</methodname> and to
	  try to lock, it is <methodname>trylock()</methodname>.
	  A lock() and trylock() on a recursive mutex from the same
	  thread will always succeed, otherwise, it blocks.
	</para>
	<para>
	  For ease of use, there is a <classname>RTT::OS::MutexLock</classname> which
	  gets a Mutex as argument in the constructor. As long as the
	  MutexLock object exists, the given Mutex is locked. This is
	  called a scoped lock.
	</para>
	<example>
	  <title>Locking a Mutex</title>
	  <para>The first listing shows a complete lock over a function :</para>
	  <programlisting>  <classname>RTT::OS::Mutex</classname> m;
  void foo() {
     int i;
     <classname>RTT::OS::MutexLock</classname> lock(m);
     // m is locked.
     // ...
  } // when leaving foo(), m is unlocked.  </programlisting>
	  <para>
	    Any scope is valid, so if the critical section is smaller than
	    the size of the function, you can :
	  </para>
	  <programlisting>  <classname>RTT::OS::Mutex</classname> m;
  void bar() {
     int i;
     // non critical section
     {
        <classname>RTT::OS::MutexLock</classname> lock(m);
        // m is locked.
        // critical section
     } //  m is unlocked.
     // non critical section
     //...
  }  </programlisting>
	</example>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Signals and Semaphores</title>
	<para>
	  Orocos provides a C++ semaphore abstraction class
	  <classname>RTT::OS::Semaphore</classname>. It is used mainly for 
	  non periodic, blocking tasks or threads. The higher level
	  Event implementation in CoreLib can be used for thread safe
	  signalling and data exchange in periodic tasks.
	</para>
	  <programlisting>  <classname>RTT::OS::Semaphore</classname> sem(0); // initial value is zero.
  void foo() {
     // Wait on sem, decrement value (blocking ):
     sem.wait()
     // awake : another thread did signal().

     // Signal sem, increment value (non blocking):
     sem.signal();

     // try wait on sem (non blocking):
     bool result = sem.trywait();
     if (result == false ) {
         // sem.value() was zero
     } else {
         // sem.value() was non-zero and is now decremented.
     }
  }  </programlisting>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Compare And Swap ( CAS )</title>
	<para>
	  CAS is a fundamental building block of the CoreLib classes
	  for inter-thread communication and must be implemented for
	  each OS target. See the Lock-Free sections of the CoreLib manual
	  for Orocos classes which use this primitive.
