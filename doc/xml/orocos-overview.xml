    <title>What is Orocos?</title>
    <para>
      &ldquo;&orocos;&rdquo; is the acronym of the
      <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.orocos.org">Open Robot Control
	  Software</ulink></emphasis> project. The project's aim is to develop
      a general-purpose, free software, and modular <emphasis>framework</emphasis>
      for <emphasis>robot</emphasis>and <emphasis>machine control</emphasis>.
      The &orocos; project supports 4 C++ libraries: the Real-Time Toolkit, the
      Kinematics and Dynamics Library, the Bayesian Filtering Library and
      the Orocos Component Library.

	  The &orocos; Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) is not an application
	  in itself, but it provides the infrastructure and the
	  functionalities to build robotics applications in C++. The

      <listitem>

	  The &orocos; Bayesian Filtering Library (BFL) provides an

	  (Extended) Kalman Filters, Particle Filters (Sequential

    <para>
      Robotics or machine control in general is a very broad field,
      and many roboticists are pursuing quite different goals, dealing
      with different levels of complexity, real-time control
      constraints, application areas, user interaction, etc.  So,
      because the robotics community is not homogeneous, &orocos;
      targets four different categories of &ldquo;Users&rdquo; (or, in
      the first place, &ldquo;Developers&rdquo;):

	    <emphasis>Framework Builders.</emphasis>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    These developers do not work on any specific application, but
	    they provide the infrastructure code to support applications. This
	    level of supporting code is most often neglected in robot software
	    projects, because in the (rather limited) scope of each individual 
	    project, putting a lot of effort in a generic support platform is
	    often considered to be &ldquo;overkill&rdquo;, or even not taken into
	    consideration at all. However, because of the large scope of the
	    &orocos; project, the supporting code (the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo;)
	    gets a lot of attention. The hope is, of course, that this work will
	    pay of by facilitating the developments for the other
	    &ldquo;Builders&rdquo;. The RTT, KDL and BFL are created by Framework
	    builders
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Component Builders.</emphasis>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Components provide a &ldquo;service&rdquo; within an
	    application.  Using the infrastructure of the framework, a
	    Component Builder describes the interface of a service and
	    provides one or more implementations. For example a 
	    Kinematics Component may be designed as such that it can
	    &ldquo;serve&rdquo; different kinematic architectures.
	    Other examples are Components to hardware devices, Components
	    for diagnostics, safety or simulation. The OCL is created by 
	    Component Builders.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Application Builders.</emphasis>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    These developers use the &orocos;' Framework and
	    Components, and integrate them into one particular
	    application. That means that they create a specific,
	    application-dependent <emphasis>architecture</emphasis>:
	    Components are connected and configured as such that they
	    form an application.

	    <emphasis>End Users.</emphasis>

      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      End Users do not directly belong to the target audience of
      the &orocos; project, because &orocos; concentrates on the common
      <emphasis>framework</emphasis>, independent of any application
      architecture. Serving the needs of the End Users is left to
      (commercial and non-commercial) Application Builders.

    <title>Building Orocos Applications</title>
    <para>
      Orocos applications are composed of software components, which form
      an application specific network. When using Orocos, you can choose
      to use predefined components, contributed by the community, or
      build your own component, using the Orocos Real-Time Toolkit. 
      This section introduces both ways of building applications.

	<title>Application Templates</title>
	<para>
	  An "Application Template" is a set of components that work
	  well together. For example, the application template for
	  motion control contains components for path planning,
	  position control, hardware access and data reporting. The
	  components are choosen as such that their interfaces are
	  compatible.
	</para>
	<para>
	  An application template should be so simple that any Orocos
	  user can pick one and modify it, hence it is the first thing
	  a new user will encounter. An application template should be
	  explainable on one page with one figure explaining the
	  architecture.
	</para>
	<note>
	  <para>An application template has no relation to 'C++'
	  templates.

	<title>Control Components</title>
	<para>
	  Applications are constructed using the Orocos
	  "Control Component". A distributable entity which has a
	  control oriented interface.

	<para>
	  A single component may be well capable of controlling a
	  whole machine, or is just a 'small' part in a whole network
	  of components, for example an interpolator or kinematic
	  component. The components are built with the "Real-Time
	  Toolkit" and optionally make use of any other library (like
	  a vision or kinematics toolkit). Most users will interface components
	  through their (XML) properties or command/method interface
	  in order to configure their applications.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are five distinct ways in which an Orocos
	  component can be interfaced: through its properties,
	  events, methods, commands and data flow ports
	  (<xref linkend="fig-orocos-component-interface" />).
	  These are all optional interfaces. The purpose and
	  use of these interface 'types' is documented in the
	  Orocos Component Builder's Manual. Each component
	  documents its interface as well. To get a grip
	  on what these interfaces mean, here are some
	  fictuous component interfaces for a 'Robot' Component:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Data-Flow Ports:</emphasis> Are a thread-safe
	    data transport mechanism to communicate buffered or
	    un-buffered data between components.  For example:
	    "JointSetpoints", "EndEffectorFrame",
	    "FeedForward",...</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Properties:</emphasis> Are run-time
	    modifyable parameters, stored in XML files. For example:
	    "Kinematic Algorithm", "Control Parameters", "Homing
	    Position", "ToolType",...</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Methods:</emphasis> Are callable by other
	    components to 'calculate' a result immediately, just like
	    a 'C' function. For example: "getTrackingError()",
	    "openGripper()", "writeData("filename")", "isMoving()",
	    ...</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Commands:</emphasis> Are 'sent' by other
	    components to instruct the receiver to 'reach a goal' For
	    example: "moveTo(pos, velocity)", "home()",... A command
	    cannot, in general, be completely executed
	    instantaneously, so the caller should not block and wait
	    for its completion. But the Command object offers all
	    functionalities to let the caller know about the progress
	    in the execution of the command.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>Events:</emphasis> Allows functions to be
	    executed when a change in the system occurs. For example:
	    "Position Reached", "Emergency Stop", "Object
	    Grasped",...</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Besides defining the above component communication
	  mechanisms, Orocos allows the Component or Application
	  Builder to write hierarchical state machines which use these
	  primitives. This is the Orocos way of defining your
	  application specific logic. State machines can be (un-)loaded
	  at runtime in any component.
