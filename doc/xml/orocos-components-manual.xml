    <title>How to Read this Manual</title>
    <para>
      This manual is for Software developers who wish to write their
      own software components using the Orocos Real-Time Toolkit.
      There is also a Core Primitives Reference Chapter at the end to find out
      the precise semantics of our communication primitives and other
      important classes.  The Orocos hardware and OS abstraction is included
      as well. The HTML version of this manual links to the 
      API documentation of all classes.
    </para>
    <section><title>Component Interfaces</title>
    <para>
      The most important Chapters to get started building a component
      are presented first. Orocos components are implemented using the
      'TaskContext' class and the following Chapter explains step by
      step how to define the interface of your component, such that
      you can interact with your component from a user interface
      or other component.
    </para></section>
    <section><title>Component Implementation</title>
    <para>
      For implementing algorithms within your component, various C++
      function <emphasis>hooks</emphasis> are present in wich you
      can place custom C++ code. As your component's functionality grows,
      you can extend its <emphasis>scripting</emphasis> interface
      and call your algorithms from a script.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Orocos Scripting Chapter details how to write programs and
      state machines. "Advanced Users" may benefit from this Chapter
      as well since the scripting language allows to 'program'
      components without recompiling the source.

      <title>Orocos Real-Time Toolkit Overview</title>
      <para>
	The Real-Time Toolkit allows setup, distribution and
	the building of real-time software components. It is
	sometimes refered to as 'middleware' because it sits
	between the application and the Operating System.
	It takes care of the real-time communication and execution of 
	software components.

	Orocos provides a limited set of components for application
	development. The Orocos Component Library (OCL) is a
	collection of components ranging from general purpose to
	hardware specific components. They serve as an example,
	although some are using complex constructs of the Real-Time
	Toolkit. Two noteworthy components are the
	<classname>OCL::TaskBrowser</classname> and the
	<classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname>. The former
	provides a console which allows you to manipulate remote or
	in-process components and lets you browse the component
	network. The latter is a component which can load other
	components into the same process. For beginners, the
	TaskBrowser is used to instruct the DeploymentComponent to
	load, connect and configure a given list of components, but
	for matured applications, the DeploymentComponent is given an
	XML file which describes which components to load, connect and
	start in the current application.
      </para>
      <para>
	The components of the Orocos Component Library are documented
	seperately on the <ulink url="http://www.orocos.org/ocl">OCL
	webpage</ulink>.

      <title>Orocos Real-Time Toolkit Software Structure</title>
      <para>
	The Real-Time Toolkit is structured in layers on top
	of the Operating System and the devices (IO).

      <para> 
	An Orocos component is built upon the Real-Time Toolkit (RTT)
	library.  It allows you to build components which are
	accessible over a network, configurable using XML files and
	listen to a scripting interface, which allows components to be
	controlled using text commands. A component which accesses IO
	devices can use the Orocos Device Interface as well which
	defines how to interact with analog and digital IO and
	encoders.  Of course, components can make use of external,
	non-Orocos libraries as well.
      </para>
      <para>
	Orocos components which only use the Real-Time Toolkit are
	portable over different Operating Systems (OS) and processor
	architectures. Orocos has an internal OS abstraction which
	allows the components to run on any supported
	architecture. When your component uses an external library,
	for example a camera or vision library, portability depends on
	these libraries.
